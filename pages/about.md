Hi! I’m Joe. I’m an IT professional from South Bend Indiana. A lover of Linux, craft beer, and huge fan of mixed martial arts, I’ve been a computer nerd in one way or another for the past 19 years. Some of my interests involve cybersecurity, cryptocurrencies, and web development. Here I will rant, teach, and inform you about said interests. When I’m not enjoying a tasty double IPA and watching MMA fights, or working on my projects, you can find me spending time with my family.

Want to work together? You can find me on social media with the links below or you can send me a message on my [contact page](/contact). I’d love to hear from you.
